The main purpose of this training is to initiate young engineers to software development through learning
and practising of LVGL as a typical project to start with. LVGL is an open source graphic library in increased adoption within the world of embedded systems. 

This training is a valuable asset especially for those seeking their first job as it covers many topics and tips 
related to software development and design from low level HAL to application (Read description below).


##  🎯 Goals

 *  Learn about LVGL and understand each part of it
 *  Build knowledge about display screen as a peripheral and its functional building blocks
 *  Co-Write, with the trainer, LVGL code and compile it and use an emulator to screen the widgets
 *  Use toolchains, co-write Makefiles and other tasks of software engineering.  

## 📂👨🏻‍🔧 From the inside

 * 
 *  Compile LVGL Library using an editor like Eclipse CDT
